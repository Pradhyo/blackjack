# Blackjack using Reinforcement Learning

The aim of this project is to produce a Blackjack strategy using decaying epsilon-greedy Q-learning that will earn more than the average casino player.

All the code is in the notebook [`blackjack.ipynb`](https://github.com/Pradhyo/blackjack/blob/master/blackjack.ipynb).

To run:    
- Install support for [*Jupyter Notebooks*](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
- Install gym if necessary `pip install gym`
- `jupyter notebook blackjack.ipynb`
